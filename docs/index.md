# OpenFaaS Platform Research

Welcome to the OpenFaaS Platform Research documentation. This repository contains comprehensive research and documentation for building modern serverless platforms using OpenFaaS Pro, k3s, and Supabase.

## Project Overview

We're exploring **OpenFaaS Pro** as the foundation for a scalable serverless platform, combined with:
- **k3s** - Lightweight Kubernetes for efficient resource usage
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service for authentication, database, and storage
- **AI Stack** - GPU-powered functions for intelligent features

## Documentation Sections

### Architecture
- **[Overview](01-architecture.md)** - System design and component relationships
- **[Scaling Strategy](03-scaling.md)** - Growth from single node to multi-node cluster

### Analysis
- **[Edition Comparison](04-comparison.md)** - OpenFaaS Community vs Pro features
- **[Alternatives](05-alternatives.md)** - OpenFaaS Pro vs Knative comparison

### Setup
- **[Setup Roadmap](02-setup-roadmap.md)** - Step-by-step setup roadmap


## Quick Start

1. **Review the architecture** → [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md)
2. **Understand the differences** → [04-comparison.md](04-comparison.md)
3. **Follow the setup roadmap** → [02-setup-roadmap.md](02-setup-roadmap.md)
4. **Plan your scaling strategy** → [03-scaling.md](03-scaling.md)

## Key Insights

### OpenFaaS Edition Choice
- **Community Edition (CE)**: Free but limited to personal use or 60-day commercial trial
- **Pro Standard**: ~$1,200/month - Recommended for commercial environments
- **Pro Enterprise**: Custom pricing - For advanced compliance and multi-tenancy needs

**Recommendation**: Use Pro Standard for any commercial development beyond 60 days.

### Why This Stack?
- **Cost-effective**: k3s reduces resource overhead
- **Scalable**: OpenFaaS handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Modern**: Serverless functions with AI capabilities
- **Developer-friendly**: Supabase provides ready-to-use backend services
